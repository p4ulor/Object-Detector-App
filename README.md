## Technology introduction
[MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) is an open-source project from Google. It consists of a library that facilitate the integration of AI & ML into your applications. It provides pre-trained models like it's [shown here](https://mediapipe-studio.webapps.google.com/home). Note: MediaPipe uses or is based on the TensorFlow Lite, and provides an easier way to add some basic ML capabilities to your apps. Per example, you don't need to download models and put them in the *assets* folder.

I'm using Jetpack Compose and Gradle's Kotlin DSL. Inspired by [mediapipe-samples - object_detection](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe-samples/tree/main/examples/object_detection/android-jetpack-compose)
